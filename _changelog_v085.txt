%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
%% 2018-06-22
% [pop_overweightevents.m],[overweightevents.m]
% Function to create optimized ICA training data (OPTICAT) for correcting 
% (free viewing) EEG experiment with many ocular artifacts
% See Dimigen et al., 2018 for a description and evaluation

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
%% 2018-06-22
% [pop_rejeyecontin.m],[rejeyecontin.m]
% Intervals with bad data must be marked or removed before saccade detection.
% Previously, it was only possible to remove intervals with out-of-range ET
% data from the continuous data or to remove whole epochs (in case of 
% epoched data). The new pop_rejeyecontin.m functions allows to instead
% add a special marker ("bad_ET") to EEG.event for each bad data interval. 
% These markers are considered by the eye movement detection function 
% (pop_detecteyemovements.m); the dataset is not cut.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
%% 2017-10-18: Bug fix: Incorrect "urevent" latencies for eye movement events
% [addevents.m] [but see also: detecteyemovements.m]

% This bugfix is relevant for (power)users who use the EEG.urevent
% structure of EEGLAB. During eye movement detection, new saccade and fixation 
% events, added by function addevent, are also added to EEGLABs "urevent"
% structure (EEG.urevent). EEG.urevent contains a representation of the original 
% event history of the dataset, before segmentation into epochs.
% This urevent info can be quite useful in some research contexts. 
% When writing EYE-EEG we have decided that information about the (new) 
% eye movement events should also be added to the EEG.urevent structure, 
% because this is often quite helpful for advanced analyses. 
% Previously however, the EEG.urevent.latency for new (eye movement) events
% added using function addevents() was wrong, if the dataset was already cut into 
% epochs when the detecteyemovements and addevents functions were executed.
% The data stored in EEG.event.latency was always correct.
% This has now been fixed.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
%% 2017-00-00: Replace function smooth() in ploteventrate
% [ploteventrate.m]
%
% Replaced function smooth() in ploteventrate, because it requires 
% the commerical Curve Fitting Toolbox 


% As of EYE-EEG version 0.80

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
%% 2016-10-28: New cross-correlation method to evaluate synch. quality
% [pop_checksynch.m]
% added pop_checksync() function which allows to assess synchronization 
% quality by cross-correlation of eye tracker (gaze) and electro-oculogram 
% (EOG) channels. We propose this as a new method to evaluate the synchronization
% of ET and EEG data based on the actual signals, rather than based only
% on common (trigger) events
%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
%% 2016-09-07: Support for "Tobii Pro" eye trackers
% [pop_parsetobii.m, parsetobii.m]
% 
% Allows to read data recorded with "Tobii Pro" eye trackers. Please refer
% to the EYE-EEG website for details about this new function. 
% Thanks to Estefania Dominguez from Tobii for developing this function 
% with us.
%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
%% 2017-01-13: Automatic import of "other" ET messages
% [parseeyelink.m, parsesmi.m, pop_importeyetracker.m, synchronize.m]
% Messages are ASCII-text message lines in the raw eye tracking data.
% In the past, EYE-EEG only considered messages that contained a special
% keyword for the purpose of synchronization.
%
% Now, EYE-EEG also parses and imports other eye tracking messages 
% (for Eyelink and SMI data), because sometimes, information about the 
% experiment (e.g. trial, condition) is only contained in 'message lines', 
% but not in the EEG triggers. In this case, it is helpful to also import 
% the messages into the synchronized/resampled ET/EEG dataset with their
% new timestamp. 
% Functions parseeyelink(), synchronize(), and pop_importeyetracker() were 
% changed such that message information is now also imported. Messages are 
% stored in field 'EEG.etc.othermessages' of EEGLAB's data structure 
% together with their new latency in the synchronized dataset. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 

% MINOR FEATURES & BUG FIXES
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% 2015-03-27: Fixed problem with EEG from ANT systems
% [addevent.m]
% Problem: The ANT data importer does not fill the EEG.urevent structure, 
% leading to a crash of this function. Solution: Fixed by calling
% eeg_checkset() to re-create ur-events as follows:
% 
% if isempty(EEG.urevent)
%    fprintf('\nWarning: EEG.urevent is empty. Recreating... 
%    urevents with eeg_checkset before adding new events...\n')
%    EEG = eeg_checkset(EEG,'makeur') % recreate ur-events
% end
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% 2015-03-27: Minor bug fix
% [microsacc_plugin.m]
% fixed function call for function 'velthresh(vel)', which was misspelled 
% as 'velthreshold(vel)' 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% 2015-09-17: User feedback
% [synchronize.m]
% improved clarity of wording in screen outputs about the quality of 
% synchronization
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% 2015-09-17: ET channel names
% [pop_importeyetracker.m]
% Underscores and empty spaces in ET channel names are now replaced with 
% '-' (rather than underscores) because underscores affect the 
% text-formatting in MATLAB (e.g. in function > Plot > Continuous data).
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
%% 2015-09-19: User feedback
% [ploteyemovements.m]
% Improved clarity of the wording of screen outputs
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% 2017-01-13: User-defined searchRadius to identify shared events
% [pop_importeyetracker.m, synchronize.m]
%
% Allow user to set 'searchRange' to identify shared events.
% Added additional function input searchRange in pop_importeyetracker. 
% This input affects how EYE-EEG identifies instances of 'shared' events 
% that are present in both recordings (but possibly not at the exact same 
% latency due to some transmission time jitter). Around each 
% event (trigger) in the EEG, EYE-EEG will search for plusminus
% searchRadius samples for an ET event of the same type (e.g. '123'). These
% shared events are then entered into the linear regression to optimize the 
% clock drift/alignment between both recordings. However, in some cases, 
% errors may occur if multiple events of the same type (e.g. '123') were 
% send in close succession (e.g. only 5 ms apart) during the experiment, 
% because then multiple ET events may be in the searchRange around the EEG
% trigger. In this case, it makes sense to decrease search range 
% a little bit. Otherwise, stick to the default of 4 samples.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%  2017-01-14: User-feedback if ET file cannot be found
% [pop_importeyetracker.m]
% Previously, there was no feedback/errormessage if the specified .mat file
% for the eye tracker did not exist.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%  2017-02-15: Storage of information in EEG.etc.eyetracker
% [pop_importeyetracker.m], [pop_etica.m]
%
% Various useful information about the eye tracking data is now stored in
% the field EEG.etc.eyetracker...
% -- histogram of sync error informing about the datasets synchronization quality
% -- the content and new EEG latency of "other" messages contained in the ET 
%    raw data. 
% -- saccade/fixation variance ratio of ICA-components
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%  2017-02-15: Bugfix: Estimated ET sampling rate was given as "0 Hz"
% [synchronize.m]
%
% Fixed bug with some ET setups. Due to the bug, the estimated ET sampling
% rate (relative to the EEG master clock) was reported as "0 Hz" during
% synchronization. Fixed this by adding exception for special cases in
% which parallel port inputs were send using separate INPUT lines in the
% raw ET data.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%  2017-02-15: Bugfix: pop_importeyetracker: wrong filename feedback
% [pop_importeyetracker]
%
% Fixed bug where the function did not produce an error message (just 
% stayed silent and did nothing) if the user entered a wrong filename or a
% non-existing filepath.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% 2017-05-03 
% [pop_eyetrackerica.m, eyetrackerica.m]
% The pop_eyetrackerica uses the duration of saccades and fixations. 
% Although the EEGLAB documentation is inconsistent regarding this issue,
% event durations in EEG.event appear to be given in SAMPLES rather than 
% microsaccades. That is why the duration of eye movements and fixations is
% also stored as samples in EEG.event.duration. 
%
% However, the values in EEG.event.duration were NOT updated by older versions
% of EEGLABs data resampling function pop_resample. This means that if user 
% choses to resample their (synchronized) EEG data, the fixation duration and 
% saccade duration values will be incorrect afterwards. Importantly, this
% will also compromise the outputs of the pop_eyetrackerica function, which 
% uses the event duration information for saccades and fixations. 
%
% A warning has now been added to the documentation of pop_eyetrackerica 
% and eyetrackerica. Thanks to C. Huber-Huber for noticing this bug (in May
% 2017) and to the EEGLAB team for agreeing to fix it in new EEGLAB versions.
